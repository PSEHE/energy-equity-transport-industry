# energy-equity-transport-industry
Annie Dillon's code analyzing the transportation and industry sectors of NV, NM, and CO for the Energy Equity project (2020).

To run the code, download the corresponding data files from this folder on Drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1w7hxv7JjZUz9DurMA5TehsYwFOuJKxrS?usp=sharing. Save all data one directory up from folder with .ipynb files so that data file paths in .ipynb files are correct. If you run into a file_path error when running any of the .ipynb files, make sure that data is saved in the correct place relative to the code, or edit the file_path read in by the code.
